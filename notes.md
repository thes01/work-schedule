- two days free after one/two night shifts
- max two consecutive shifts, apart from night/afternoon/afternoon
- holidays first, weekends second, then the workdays
- "buffer" shifts by the end of the half-year

- 11h morning, 12? night
- morning shift - 8h morning only Mon-Fri (only one nurse like this all days, some nurses combined)
- maybe each nurse will have one 8h shift extra (because of the reduction from 12 to 11) per month
